# TradeFlow AI
## Hackathon Design Specification v1.0

---

# 1. Vision

TradeFlow AI is an AI-powered trade finance platform built on XRPL.

The platform reduces cross-border settlement risk by combining:

- RLUSD settlement
- TokenEscrow
- AI invoice extraction
- Agent-assisted workflow automation

The goal is to provide a secure payment flow between international buyers and suppliers.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

International trade payments are slow, expensive, and risky.

Example:

Swiss Import AG buys goods from Vietnam Textiles Ltd.

Current process:

- Invoice emailed
- Manual verification
- Bank involvement
- Delayed payment
- Settlement uncertainty

Challenges:

- Suppliers want payment guarantees
- Buyers want delivery guarantees
- Working capital gets locked up
- Cross-border settlement takes time

---

# 3. Solution

TradeFlow AI introduces programmable trade settlement.

Workflow:

Buyer receives invoice
↓
AI extracts invoice details
↓
Buyer approves transaction
↓
RLUSD placed into Escrow
↓
Supplier can verify funds exist
↓
Delivery confirmed
↓
Escrow automatically releases RLUSD
↓
Settlement completed

---

# 4. Core Value Proposition

Traditional Payment:

Buyer
↓
Send Money
↓
Supplier

Problems:

- Money is immediately gone
- No guarantee of delivery
- High dispute risk

TradeFlow AI:

Buyer
↓
RLUSD Escrow
↓
Delivery Verification
↓
Supplier Receives Payment

Benefits:

- Funds reserved immediately
- Supplier gains confidence
- Buyer remains protected
- Settlement risk reduced
- Faster reconciliation

One-line pitch:

"RLUSD provides instant settlement, Escrow provides trust, and AI automates the workflow."
